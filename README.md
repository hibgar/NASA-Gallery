# NASA-Gallery

https://hibgar.github.io/NASA-Gallery/

Using data from NASA's API, I designed this website to display recent photos of the Earth taken by NASA satellites. The page is designed in a social media-type fashion similar to Instagram with functional like buttons.

# Goals
* Retrieve, parse, and display data from API
* Add a functional like button
* Arrow to jump back to top if the user scrolls down
* Implement a loading state while data is being fetched
* Responsive over different screen sizes

# API
I utilized NASA's EPIC API, receiving data collected from the NASA Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera to generate the content on the page.
